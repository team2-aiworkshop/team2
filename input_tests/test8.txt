    Program purpose and program phasing:
The objective of the Agricultural Development and Credit Program is to return Azerbaijan's
farming areas to former levels of productivity under a new system characterized by private family and
group farms operating in private markets.
    The program will support the development nationwide of: (i) an accessible, secure and unified
system for registering all rights in real estate (land and buildings); (ii) a network for financial services in
rural areas consisting of local financial intermediaries (LFIs), such as credit cooperatives and rural
branches of commercial banks, to provide private farms and other rural enterprises with market-based
financial services; (iii) mixed public and private advisory services for rural enterprises; and (iv)
Government capacity to formulate appropriate policy responses to the impact of the anticipated build-up in
oil revenues on the competitiveness of the rural economy. The program will be implemented in three
phases over a ten year period. The first phase, which is described in this Project Appraisal Document
(PAD), will cover four years and will focus on registering private rights to rural farm land and on testing
mechanisms for a unified real estate registration system encompassing urban and rural land and buildings.
It will also pilot development of a self-sustainable rural financial system based on the creation of LFIs, the
establishment of rural information and advisory services and the strengthening of research and veterinary
services. Moreover, it will strengthen Government capacity to analyze and respond to the impact on rural
Azerbaijan of developments in the oil sector. Two subsequent phases lasting three years each will focus on
expanding the geographical coverage of the rural advisory services and the number of LFIs. In addition,
initiatives to encourage commercial banks to establish rural branches will be added in the subsequent
phases. In these later phases, the real estate registration system will be expanded until it reaches
nationwide coverage.

    Except for the pilot rural finance initiative, the program is largely based on the experience of the
IDA/IFAD-assisted Farm Privatization Project (FPP) which is currently under implementation. Since
1996, the FPP has worked extensively with six former state and collective farms undergoing land
privatization and farm restructuring. This work has served as the basis for the farm privatization process
now underway nationwide. It has also helped develop modalities for the provision of information and
training for emerging farmers.
Performance indicators of progress towards program objectives will be tracked through a
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system that will measure: (i) progress in registration real estate
transactions, including land and improvements; (ii) the performance of LFIs and rural bank branches
established during the program as demonstrated by their numbers, volume of lending, the financial viability
of the activities financed, and the soundness of their portfolios; (iii) the numbers and types of agents
providing information and advice to farms; (iv) the numbers of rural enterprises utilizing rural advisory
services; and (v) the adoption of new farm management practices, and changes in technology.

    Project development objective:
Private family and group farms and other private rural entrepreneurs begin to register land
transactions in large numbers, use information and advisory services, and expand investment in their farms
and other rural businesses.

    Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
The performance indicators for the first phase project are derived from the program performance
indicators discussed above. They are based on: (a) adoption of a clear institutional framework and action
plan for the creation of a unified real estate registration system; number of land titles registered and
transactions recorded; (b) the number of financial sustainable LFIs established, amount of equity raised,
and the number and amounts of loans made and recovered; (c) the number of private farm advisors trained
and working, number of private farm units serviced, and the number of research activities addressing
immediate farmer needs; and (d) demonstrated capability for agricultural strategy formulation as measured
by number of trained staff, and studies prepared and accepted by Government.

    Strategic Context
Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex I)
Document number: 15948-Az. Date of latest CAS discussion: 09/22/96
The proposed project is included in the CAS and is consistent with CAS objectives. The project
supports the Government's efforts to design and implement policies and programs conducive to the use of
Azerbaijan's oil potential to achieve sustainable growth and poverty reduction. This focus includes macro
economic policies that encourage public and private saving and investment, complemented by sector
initiatives that facilitate efficient allocation of resources, and social policies that preserve Azerbaijan's
human capital and protect those vulnerable to the changes sweeping the country. The program is directed
at: (i) establishment of a policy environment and institutional framework conducive to efficient and
equitable private sector-led sustainable growth; (ii) enhancement of competitiveness in critical economic
sectors; (iii) alleviation of poverty; and (iv) resettlement and rehabilitation of refugees. The CAS
emphasizes agriculture in the context of enhancing competitiveness in critical sectors, since it provides
ample opportunities for expanding output and incomes of Azerbaijan's poor. Specific CAS aims directly
supported by the project are: (i) creating land markets within an appropriate legal framework; and (ii)
developing a rural credit scheme and advisory services for new private farmers.

    Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Agriculture plays an important role in the Azeri economy, contributing over 30 percent of Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) and providing income and employment for 45 percent of all households. Also, it
traditionally has contributed significantly to exports both of primary commodities and processed food and
beverages. The sector produces a wide variety of products and was at one time a major producer of fruits,
vegetables and wine products for the Soviet Union. Climatic conditions are favorable to agriculture,
though low rainfall makes the sector heavily dependent on irrigation. Nearly 85 percent of cultivated area
is irrigated.At independence the Government inherited a badly functioning cormnand-based agricultural sector.
Initial attempts at reform were tentative, but the process gathered momentum in the mid-1990s and has
moved rapidly since. Most state and collective farms have been disbanded and nearly all cultivable land
has been distributed to individual households in one of the most comprehensive agrarian land reforms in the
formerly Soviet Union (FSU). Domestic and international trade in agricultural products has been
liberalized and input and output prices are market determined. There are no export taxes and import duties
have been reduced to low levels and are being made uniform  across categories.  Finally, most
agro-enterprises have been privatized. These reforms are fundamentally transforming the sector, which
centers increasingly on farming households operating in private markets.


    While the reforms have been dramatic, the sector remains mired in deep crisis. Output and
productivity, which fell roughly by two thirds during the period since 1990, has stabilized in recent years,
but there is little evidence yet of a recovery. Rather, the sector is stuck in a low level trap, in which
emerging farm households lack the resources to re-establish the intensity of farming operations required to
make irrigated agriculture a viable way of life. Economic and financial models for a large range of rural
activities show that they are potentially highly profitable with high rates of return. However, several key
constraints must be overcome before these rates can be achieved. Principal among these are: (i) the lack of
capital due to non-functioning rural financial markets; (ii) post privatization land issues, particularly the
need to establish a reliable register for land titles; (iii) lack of technical and managerial know-how,
particularly among the newly established farming households; and (iv) a rapidly deteriorating irrigation
infrastructure that is affecting water availability.

    The Government is acutely aware of the need to address these constraints in order to close the
productivity gap and restore the competitiveness of the sector. The Government is also worried that the
expected rapid development of oil revenues will cause an appreciation of the real exchange rate which
could have a negative impact on sector competitiveness. In response to these concerns, the Government is
developing programs with donor support to address the key constraints in the sector and to make the
necessary investments in public goods and services that will help it maintain its competitiveness in face of
adverse exchange rate movements. The program described in this PAD is one part of a two pronged
strategy to turn the sector around and focuses on improving key services for the agricultural sector. The
second prong is the comprehensive rehabilitation of the irrigation infrastructure and reform of irrigation
management which is also receiving support from the Bank through two planned operations in FY00 and
FY01. For the current program the Government is focusing on the following components:
(i) Rural Finance: Increased availability of rural financial services is one of the Government's key
and most urgent policy objectives. Lack of access to finance has negatively affected rural growth as the
sector has not been able to adjust to a market economy. Access to financial services is necessary so that
rural entrepreneurs can take advantage of the recent market reforms to adjust factor proportions, modify
output mixes, change the scale of operations, and invest in new technologies.
Private farms and other rural enterprises lack access to credit for a number of reasons. Under the
old Soviet system, all agricultural credit was provided by the state-owned Agroprom Bank. Commercial
banks provided no lending to the sector whatsoever. Agroprom basically collapsed following independence
and is now undergoing restructuring. It will be years, if ever, before a restructured Agroprom emerges as a
provider of financial services. Meanwhile, the commercial banks have not moved to fill this void. They are
small, poorly capitalized and face a shortage of loanable funds. They are currently undergoing a major
consolidation as the Government implements a comprehensive financial sector reform that emphasizes
increased capital requirements and tighter banking supervision. None of these Banks have rural branches
and under the circumstances they are not generally looking to expand into new lines of business.  At
present their technology and high cost structures are ill suited to reach large numbers of small,
geographically dispersed customers such as farmers and rural enterprises. These banks also perceive rural
lending to be high cost and high risk. There perception of risk is reinforced by the belief that rural
borrowers do not have adequate collateral and the collateral they do have is difficult to use.
To address these constraints and to increase the flow of savings and credit in rural areas, the
Government has designed a comprehensive strategy to develop financial markets in rural areas. Over the
long-term the strategy envisages the development of a multi-channel rural financial system involving both
commnercial banks and other non bank financial intermediaries. In the short-run, the strategy focuses on
reducing risks and costs by: (i) improving the framework for the use of collateral through developing registries for both land and moveable property; and (ii) developing lending mechanisms that emphasize
group screening and joint liability, effectively substituting social capital for physical collateral. In support
of this short-term approach, the Government intends to launch a pilot initiative to develop sustainable LFIs
and to provide them with loanable funds. The pilot initiative will entail the following actions.

    Improving the legal and institutional environment for credit transactions by: (i) developing the
implementation rules for a recently passed law on secured transactions; and (ii) preparing options
for registration of interests secured with movable assets in accordance with the new law. These
two actions will allow use of movable assets such as inventories of inputs and crops as collateral
for rural loans.

    Creating and strengthening sound and competitive financial institutions. During the first stage
credit cooperatives (CCs), a specific type of LFI, will be promoted. The Government has already
issued a legal and regulatory framework for CCs. They can be incorporated under the "Law on
Enterprises" as Limited Liability Enterprises and will be licensed under the Azerbaijan National
Bank (ANB) decision "Rules of Licensing and Regulating the Banking Activities of Credit
Cooperatives." This legal framework, combined with appropriate prudential norms and effective
supervision, will provide the environment for the development of a safe and sound system of CCs.
A number of CCs have been established on a pilot basis under the new regulations and initial
indications are that these CCs have the ability to raise local funds as equity or savings. CCs will be
provided with accounting procedures, management information systems, portfolio monitoring
instruments, internal control procedures, operational manuals, training packages, and design of
financial services to be offered to their members.

    Using solidarity groups as transitional channels for donor provided funds. This second type of
LFI will be groups of borrowers with 10 to 20 individual farmers and micro-entrepreneurs. These
groups will be assisted to act collectively to obtain credit on the basis of their joint liability. Social
capital in the form of existing character information, peer monitoring, and local enforcement will
be the main instrument to guarantee the group's repayment. These groups of borrowers will not
need a legal incorporation nor a ANB license as they will not be allowed to collect deposits from
the public.

    Making term funds available to be on-lent to final borrowers through LFIs. Donor financed
credit lines will be made available until banks or other market-based lenders can provide rural
credit. Nonetheless, to permit the development of market alternatives, these credit lines will be: (i)
transitory; (ii) well targeted; (iii) appropriately priced --at market rates and with adequate margins
to LFIs to cover all costs, including credit risks and profit margin; and (iv) well designed in terms
of recovery incentives for all intermediaries making credit decisions.

    Improving prudential regulations and banking supervision by developing a complete set of
prudential norms for CCs as well as the procedures, methods, and instruments required to
supervise their compliance together with reporting requirements, supervisory triggers, and licensing
steps at the ANB.The Government is taking a bold and novel approach to rural finance by creating from scratch
local institutions to intermediate credit to the rural sector in a country where the banking sector is
undergoing a major shake out and where there exist no branches in rural areas. Nonetheless, the dearth of
capital available to finance necessary inputs to new private farms is one of the most important impediments
to growth in the sector. While the untested nature of this approach makes it high risk, the clear benefits to
