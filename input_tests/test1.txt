	Cytoplasm and Cytoskeleton:
	The environment inside the plasma membrane is a
semifluid material called cytoplasm. Scientists once thought
the organelles of eukaryotic cells floated freely in the cell’s
cytoplasm. As technology improved, scientists discovered
more about cell structures. They discovered a structure within
the cytoplasm called the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton is a
network of long, thin protein fibers that provide an anchor
for organelles inside the cell. The cell’s shape and movement
depend on the cytoskeleton.
	Two types of protein fibers make up the cytoskeleton.
Microtubules are long, hollow protein cylinders that form a
firm skeleton for the cell. They assist in moving substances
within the cell. Microfilaments are thin protein threads that
help give the cell shape and enable the entire cell or parts of
the cell to move.
