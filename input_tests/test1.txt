Cytoplasm and Cytoskeleton
The environment inside the plasma membrane is a
semifl uid material called cytoplasm. Scientists once thought
the organelles of eukaryotic cells fl oated freely in the cell’s
cytoplasm. As technology improved, scientists discovered
more about cell structures. They discovered a structure within
the cytoplasm called the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton is a
network of long, thin protein fi bers that provide an anchor
for organelles inside the cell. The cell’s shape and movement
depend on the cytoskeleton.
Two types of protein fi bers make up the cytoskeleton.
Microtubules are long, hollow protein cylinders that form a
fi rm skeleton for the cell. They assist in moving substances
within the cell. Microfi laments are thin protein threads that
help give the cell shape and enable the entire cell or parts of
the cell to move.
