	Cytoplasm and Cytoskeleton:
The environment inside the plasma membrane is a
semifluid material called cytoplasm. Scientists once thought
the organelles of eukaryotic cells floated freely in the cell’s
cytoplasm. As technology improved, scientists discovered
more about cell structures. They discovered a structure within
the cytoplasm called the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton is a
network of long, thin protein fibers that provide an anchor
for organelles inside the cell. The cell’s shape and movement
depend on the cytoskeleton.
	Two types of protein fibers make up the cytoskeleton.
Microtubules are long, hollow protein cylinders that form a
firm skeleton for the cell. They assist in moving substances
within the cell. Microfilaments are thin protein threads that
help give the cell shape and enable the entire cell or parts of
the cell to move.
	Cell Structures:
All chemical processes of a typical eukaryotic cell take place
in the organelles, which move around in the cell’s cytoplasm.
Proteins are produced, food is transformed into energy, and
wastes are processed in the organelles. Each organelle has a
unique structure and function.
	How are plant and animal cells different?
The figure below shows a typical plant cell and a typical
animal cell. Note how many organelles are found in both types
of cells. Also, note a few differences, such as the chloroplast
that appears only in the plant cell. Observe that the vacuole
in the plant cell is much larger than the vacuole in the animal
cell.
	What structure manages cell processes?
The nucleus is the cell’s managing structure. Most of the
cell’s genetic material (DNA) is in the nucleus. DNA defines
the cell and controls protein production. A nuclear envelope
surrounds the nucleus. Substances pass through the nuclear
envelope to move in and out of the nucleus.
	Which organelle produces proteins?
Ribosomes produce proteins and are made of two
components - RNA and protein. Ribosomes are produced in
the nucleolus, a structure located inside the nucleus. Some
ribosomes float freely in the cytoplasm. They produce proteins
that will be used by other cells. Other ribosomes attach to an
organelle called the endoplasmic reticulum.
	What attaches to rough endoplasmic reticulum?
The endoplasmic reticulum, also called ER, is a membrane system of
folded sacs and channels to which ribosomes are attached.
There are two types of ER. The first type is called rough
endoplasmic reticulum. This is the area where ribosomes
attach to the ER’s surface. The ribosomes appear to create
bumps or rough places on the membrane. The second type,
smooth endoplasmic reticulum, has no ribosomes attached.
Smooth ER produces complex carbohydrates and lipids.
	What is the purpose of the Golgi apparatus?
Once proteins are created, they move to another organelle,
the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus
modifies, sorts, and packs the proteins into sacs called vesicles.
The vesicles fuse with the cell’s plasma membrane. There the
vesicles release the proteins, which move through the plasma
membrane to the environment outside the cell.
	What is stored in vacuoles?
Cells have vesicles called vacuoles that act as temporary
storage for materials in the cytoplasm. Vacuoles can store
food and other material needed by a cell. They can also store
wastes. Plant cells normally have one large vacuole. Animal
cells might or might not have a few small vacuoles.
	What are lysosomes?
Lysosomes are vesicles that contain substances that digest
excess or worn-out organelles and food particles. Lysosomes
also digest bacteria and viruses that enter the cell.
	What makes up a centriole?
Centrioles are organelles made of microtubules that
function during cell division. They usually are found near the
nucleus of the cell. Plant cells do not contain centrioles.
	Which organelle produces energy?
Cells need energy to survive. The organelles that convert
fuel particles such as sugars into usable energy are called
mitochondria. A mitochondrion has
an outer membrane and an inner membrane with many folds,
as shown in the figure below. The membrane provides a large
surface area for breaking the bonds of sugar molecules. Energy is
produced when the bonds are broken.
	How do plant and animal cells differ?
In addition to mitochondria, plant cells contain chloroplasts.
Chloroplasts are organelles that capture light energy and
convert it to chemical energy through a process called
photosynthesis. Plants can use light energy from any light
source—usually the Sun. Animal cells do not have chloroplasts
and cannot use solar energy as fuel for cell processes.
Plants also have cell walls. The cell wall is a mesh of
fibers that surrounds the plasma membrane. It protects and
supports the cell. Plant cell walls are made of a carbohydrate
known as cellulose.
	What are cilia and flagella?
Some animal cell surfaces have cilia or flagella that extend
beyond the plasma membrane. Cilia are short projections
that look like hairs. They move back and forth, similar to
the motion of the oars of a rowboat. Flagella are longer,
whiplike projections that propel cells. Both cilia and flagella
are composed of microtubules. They move cells through their
watery environments. Cilia also move substances along the
surface of the cell.
	Organelles at Work:
The structures in the cell work together to perform cell
functions. The synthesis of proteins is a major cell function,
which begins in the nucleus. Protein synthesis continues with
the ribosomes on the rough ER and the ribosomes that float
freely in the cytoplasm. Most proteins made on the rough ER
are sent to the Golgi apparatus. There they are packaged in
vesicles and sent to other organelles or out of the cell. Like each
member of a soccer team, each cell structure has a specific task
to do to make the cell function properly.
