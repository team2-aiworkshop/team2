Cell Structures
All chemical processes of a typical eukaryotic cell take place
in the organelles, which move around in the cell’s cytoplasm.
Proteins are produced, food is transformed into energy, and
wastes are processed in the organelles. Each organelle has a
unique structure and function.
For cells to function correctly, each part must do its job.
Members of families have jobs or chores that help the whole

How are plant and animal cells different?
The fi gure below shows a typical plant cell and a typical
animal cell. Note how many organelles are found in both types
of cells. Also, note a few differences, such as the chloroplast
that appears only in the plant cell. Observe that the vacuole
in the plant cell is much larger than the vacuole in the animal
cell.
