	What makes up a centriole?
Centrioles are organelles made of microtubules that
function during cell division. They usually are found near the
nucleus of the cell. Plant cells do not contain centrioles.
	Which organelle produces energy?
Cells need energy to survive. The organelles that convert
fuel particles such as sugars into usable energy are called
mitochondria. A mitochondrion has
an outer membrane and an inner membrane with many folds,
as shown in the figure below. The membrane provides a large
surface area for breaking the bonds of sugar molecules. Energy is
produced when the bonds are broken.
	How do plant and animal cells differ?
In addition to mitochondria, plant cells contain chloroplasts.
Chloroplasts are organelles that capture light energy and
convert it to chemical energy through a process called
photosynthesis. Plants can use light energy from any light
sourceâ€”usually the Sun. Animal cells do not have chloroplasts
and cannot use solar energy as fuel for cell processes.
Plants also have cell walls. The cell wall is a mesh of
fibers that surrounds the plasma membrane. It protects and
supports the cell. Plant cell walls are made of a carbohydrate
known as cellulose.
	What are cilia and flagella?
Some animal cell surfaces have cilia or flagella that extend
beyond the plasma membrane. Cilia are short projections
that look like hairs. They move back and forth, similar to
the motion of the oars of a rowboat. Flagella are longer,
whiplike projections that propel cells. Both cilia and flagella
are composed of microtubules. They move cells through their
watery environments. Cilia also move substances along the
surface of the cell.
