	Organelles at Work:
The structures in the cell work together to perform cell
functions. The synthesis of proteins is a major cell function,
which begins in the nucleus. Protein synthesis continues with
the ribosomes on the rough ER and the ribosomes that float
freely in the cytoplasm. Most proteins made on the rough ER
are sent to the Golgi apparatus. There they are packaged in
vesicles and sent to other organelles or out of the cell. Like each
member of a soccer team, each cell structure has a specific task
to do to make the cell function properly.
