	What structure manages cell processes?
The nucleus is the cell’s managing structure. Most of the
cell’s genetic material (DNA) is in the nucleus. DNA defines
the cell and controls protein production. A nuclear envelope
surrounds the nucleus. Substances pass through the nuclear
envelope to move in and out of the nucleus.
	Which organelle produces proteins?
Ribosomes produce proteins and are made of two
components - RNA and protein. Ribosomes are produced in
the nucleolus, a structure located inside the nucleus. Some
ribosomes float freely in the cytoplasm. They produce proteins
that will be used by other cells. Other ribosomes attach to an
organelle called the endoplasmic reticulum.
	What attaches to rough endoplasmic reticulum?
The endoplasmic reticulum, also called ER, is a membrane system of
folded sacs and channels to which ribosomes are attached.
There are two types of ER. The first type is called rough
endoplasmic reticulum. This is the area where ribosomes
attach to the ER’s surface. The ribosomes appear to create
bumps or rough places on the membrane. The second type,
smooth endoplasmic reticulum, has no ribosomes attached.
Smooth ER produces complex carbohydrates and lipids.
	What is the purpose of the Golgi apparatus?
Once proteins are created, they move to another organelle,
the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus
modifies, sorts, and packs the proteins into sacs called vesicles.
The vesicles fuse with the cell’s plasma membrane. There the
vesicles release the proteins, which move through the plasma
membrane to the environment outside the cell.
	What is stored in vacuoles?
Cells have vesicles called vacuoles that act as temporary
storage for materials in the cytoplasm. Vacuoles can store
food and other material needed by a cell. They can also store
wastes. Plant cells normally have one large vacuole. Animal
cells might or might not have a few small vacuoles.
	What are lysosomes?
Lysosomes are vesicles that contain substances that digest
excess or worn-out organelles and food particles. Lysosomes
also digest bacteria and viruses that enter the cell.
